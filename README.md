# WAuth: Welsh Authentication

WORK IN PROGRESS - REQUEST FOR COMMENTS

WAuth (Welsh Authentication) is our organization's product name for our upcoming browser-based sign-in system for our health and care applications.

Contact:

* Joel Henderson <joel.henderson@wales.nhs.uk>.

Key points:

* WAuth is a component that provides a simple sign in, using a typical web page dialog box.
  
* WAuth provides UI/UX capabilties for faster easier sign in, especially for clinicians in care environments such as emergency departments, critical care areas, and hospital wards.

* WAuth contact information for general inquiries, open source ideas, suggestions, and coordinated vulnerability disclosures
  
Technical details:

* WAuth provides technical capabilties for tracking interactions, primarily for stronger security tracking, and secondarily for better usability tracing.

* WAuth aims to be akin to a "LEGO block" that our teams can copy, use as they wish, customize at will, and evolve over time.

* WAuth is implemented using TypeScript, OpenTelemetry, Microsoft Entra, and the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).
